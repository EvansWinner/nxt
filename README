WARNING -- THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY WORKING YET!!!

Will remove this warning as soon as there is a 0.0.1 version...


INTRODUCTION

`nxt' is a simple command line checklist tool. You feed 
it a file filled with checklist items and it tells you
what needs to be done next.

You cannot directory specify the checklist file from
the nxt command line as a parameter. `nxt' looks in one
of the following three places for its file:

 1. File $HOME/.nxtfile			-- lowest priority
 2. File ./.nxtfile			-- seond priority
 3. Environment variable $NXTFILE	-- highest priority 

  Syntax: nxt [command] [item]
          nxt -h|--help
	  nxt -v|--version


COMMANDS 

Commands are uniquely identified by their first
letter, so nxt only checks the first letter of what
you pass it. Therefore the following are all the same:

 $ nxt d
 $ nxt done
 $ nxt dokfjg

The commands are:

 - n for "next"  -- show the next item
 - d for "done"  -- mark the next item done
 - r for "reset" -- make all items not done
 - c for "cat"   -- show all items (just cats the file)




Manual by examples: 

The basic use is just the following two:

$ nxt

 -- Show the next numbered item on your checklist.

$ nxt done

 -- Mark the next item done, then show the new next
    item.


Additional items for convenience:

$ nxt n

 -- Show just the item number of the next item.
    `n' here is not a variable, it is the literal 
    character `n'.

$ nxt init

 -- Mark all items in the file as not done.

$ nxt complete

 -- Mark all items in the file as done.

$ nxt foo

 -- Show the fifth item in the checklist, whether
    it is done or not. Here we are talking about 
    an actual digit.


When showing a checklist item, nxt shows both the 
item number tag and its status, and the item text:

$ nxt 5

:5:D
Frobnicate the foo.

$ nxt status 5

 -- Shows the status (done or not) of item 5.


An item in the file should look like this:

:2:
Do something.
::

When the item is marked done, whether by you or by
nxt, a capital letter `D' is appended to the :2:

nxt will show anything between a start tag and end
tag, including the start tag
